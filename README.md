Applied-Cryptography-RSA-Implementation
=======================================

Introduction
------------

RSA is a popular public key cryptosystem.  It uses three functions, key generation, encryption, and decryption, in conjunction with a public key and a private key to share a given message.  RSA is one of the most widely used cryptosystems in the world and one of the best known.  It can be used for both encryption/decryption or signature and verification.  The system is built upon the difficulty of factoring large numbers with some similarities to the Diffie-Hellman cryptosystem.  For this project, RSA will be implemented using OAEP padding and Chinese Remainder Theorem for decryption.  RSA variants will then be compared to the standard.
