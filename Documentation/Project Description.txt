Implementation Project
----------------------

For this project, you will implement something real.  Your implementation has
to work with real sized data (thousands of bits or example) and it should be
correct.

Proposal: Your proposal should describe what you are implementing and also
provide a short overview of it.  (What is it used for, what actual problem is
it used to solve, who/where was it invented, etc).  You must include references
to relevant sources such as standards specifications for the system, other
implementations (that are freely available), etc. Your proposal should be at
least two pages (but not significantly more).

Demo: In the last week of classes, you will demo your code.  You'll be expected
to run your code and answer questions about it. If you work in a team, all
members are expected to be present and all members will be asked about
different aspects of the code.

Potential topics: Implement a secure version of RSA (using OAEP padding,
Chinese Remainding for decryption, good creation of primes) and some variants
of RSA (and compare the efficiency of the variants), implement a secure online
voting system, implement bitcoin, etc.  Note, the work involved should be
comparable to the Paper/Presentation project.
